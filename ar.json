  "description": "Scans system-wide and user-specific startup scripts for suspicious persistence techniques and potential malicious injections. Detects signs of reverse shells, encoded payloads, remote downloads, crypto miners, environment hijacking, and prompt traps. Assigns severity levels based on findings and supports optional auto-remediation by commenting out malicious lines. Produces structured NDJSON output, including detected issues, severity, recent modification status, applied remediations, and backup paths. Writes results atomically to the Active Response log with .new fallback if locked.",
